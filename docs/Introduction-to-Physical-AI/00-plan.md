# Chapter Plan: Introduction to Physical AI

This document outlines the plan for the chapter "Introduction to Physical AI".

## Summary

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI. It distinguishes Physical AI from traditional, disembodied AI by emphasizing the importance of a physical body, interaction with the environment, and the continuous loop of perception and action. The chapter will trace the historical context that led to the development of embodied AI and introduce the Perception-Action Loop as a foundational model for understanding intelligent physical agents.

## Learning Objectives

*   Define Physical AI, Embodiment, Situatedness, and Interaction.
*   Explain the historical evolution from symbolic AI to embodied AI.
*   Describe the components and flow of the Perception-Action Loop.
*   Analyze simple robotic systems using the Perception-Action Loop framework.

## Key Topics

1.  **What is Physical AI?**
    *   Defining Embodiment
    *   Situatedness and Environmental Interaction
    *   The role of the physical body in cognition
2.  **A Brief History of AI and Robotics**
    *   Early symbolic AI (e.g., Logic Theorist, GPS)
    *   The "frame problem" and the limitations of disembodied AI
    *   The rise of behavior-based robotics (e.g., Rodney Brooks)
3.  **The Perception-Action Loop**
    *   Sensing the environment (Perception)
    *   Processing and decision-making (Cognition/Control)
    *   Acting upon the environment (Action)
    *   Feedback and learning
