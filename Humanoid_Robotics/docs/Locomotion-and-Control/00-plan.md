# Chapter Plan: Locomotion and Control

This document outlines the plan for the chapter "Locomotion and Control".

## Summary

This chapter explores the fascinating and complex problem of how to make a humanoid robot walk, run, and interact with its environment. We will delve into the fundamental principles of bipedal locomotion, including the concepts of the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM). We will then move on to more advanced control strategies, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), which allow for more dynamic and adaptive behaviors. Finally, we will examine the challenges of grasping and manipulation.
